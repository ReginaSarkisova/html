  <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>

  <h2>Linear Equations</h2>

  <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

  ax + b = 0

  where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
  equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an x
  so don’t get too locked into always seeing an x there.

  <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

  The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:

  ax^2 + bx + c = 0

  where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.

  <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

  [sign] (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:

  A = [sign] [sign] r^2

  or, when you know the diameter (D):

  A = [sign] / 4) [sign] D^2

  or, when you know the circumference (C):

  A = C^2 / 4 [sign] [sign]

  <h2>Intersection</h2>

  The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the
  sets A and B. In symbols,

  A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B }

  That is, x is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B.
